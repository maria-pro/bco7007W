## Assesment 2

In this assessment you will analyse tweets on a topic of your choice. You will explore the tweets as well as identify topics that people talk about in those tweets using topic modeling.

The general breakdown of the assessment is:

1. Tweets collecting (data mining) - should be done through a number of runs of the data mining script
2. Exploration and visualization of data (you can start doing this step as soon as you have your first data and then apply the same coding to a large dataset (=full dataset) to write up your insights
3. Topic modeling and visualization
4. Discuss your insights from steps 2-4 and identify distinct topics in your dataset

###  Tweets collecting (step 1):

Select the topic of your choice to research. The topic needs to be popular to have large number of tweets = many people talk about that topic on Twitter.

Run the script discussed in the class to collect tweets: you can use either topic as a keyword or hashtag (#keyword) for your query.

**Run your script every 3 days and save each dataset under a different filename (e.g. date_month.csv)**

Save your data from each run of the script as a separate file (see class notes)
You collect your tweets in weeks 2-4.

After you completed all data runs (end of week 4), you need to merge the files into one dataset (see class notes).

Remove duplicate entries from the dataset to have only unique entries (see class notes)


### Exploration and visualization of data

1.	Present the first 10 tweets from your dataset using `kable()`
2.	Visualise the frequency of your tweets
3.	Identify top tweeting locations and present the first 10
4.	Identify the most retweeted tweets (top 20)
5.
